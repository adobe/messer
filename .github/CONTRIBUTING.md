# Contributing to Messer

Once again, we hope you have read our [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before starting.

We are excited to work with anyone at any level contributing their time and efforts towards the project.

You can contribute in the following ways:

## Communicating through GitHub Issues
- Ask questions about the project goals, a specific use case, or clarification on documentation. Asking questions lead to issues being filed, eventually making the project more usable.
- The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull requests, but please do not derail or troll issues.
- Resolve Issues.
- Please do not submit a pull request without filing an issue. We will ask you to file one and refer to it in your commit message before we merge it.

## Coding Style

Messer follows general [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines. Apart from that, these specific rules apply:
- Indents for .py files are 4 spaces long
- Minimize [cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity). Most python style checkers also come with McCabe complexity checkers. A good rule of thumb is to limit the number of if-then-else statements to 3 and return once in a module.


## Commit message format

The commit message of your PR should be able to communicate what problem/opportunity the PR addresses.

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
